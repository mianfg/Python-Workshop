    "A notebook is a powerful tool to develop and present your Python code. It does not only allow you to write and run Python scripts: it allows you to show plots, tables, write long text, and much more! In short, it is a single document in which you can run code, display its output and add any explanation you like (including charts, equations, etc.).\n",
